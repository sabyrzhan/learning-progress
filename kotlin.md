# Kotlin lang
1. Immutable and mutable variable declarations:
```
// This is the immutable variable
val value = "This is the immutable"
// This is the mutable variable
var value2 = "This is the variable"
```
2. String interpolation with variable value and expression
```
val str = "Some string"
print("This is the string $str and its length is ${str.length}")
