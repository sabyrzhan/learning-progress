			- Finally I could make the Jetty server to work with custom `ThreadPool` class with VirtualThread support. The issue was I was shutting down the executor and setting timeout with only 3 seconds which was very small in `join()` method. So I removed the shutdown and set timeout to `Long.MAX_VALUE` seconds.

This code also has interesting discussion at Reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/ii939b/comment/g35z0a2/) regarding threads.
