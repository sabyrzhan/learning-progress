- ## Development
	- [[Java language]]

			- Implemented TCP based HTTP 1.1 based server based on [RawHttp](https://github.com/renatoathaydes/rawhttp) library. To handle to requests I decided to use some libraries from Spring ecosystem:
				- To resolve URL templates I am using `UriTemplate`
				- To make SQL operations I am using `spring-jdbc` library
				- For datasource pooling `HikariCP`
			- Added `UserRepository` and `UserFacade` classes to make user related operations
			- Overall the request to backend passes standard 3 layers:
				- `Facade` to handle user requests. Responsible to parse user requests
				- `Service` that contains the logic
				- `Repository` that interacts with DB
			- For testing purposes I am using `JMeter` and which I will use also for load testing to compare `VirtualThreadPool` vs `ThreadPool` executor performances.
