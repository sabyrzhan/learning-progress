- **How to set password to 1 in Ubuntu 22.04?** #Linux #[[Useful Tip]]
	- The password policies are specified in `/etc/pam.d/common-password`. You can change the policies directly and manually in file. However that can mess-up data integrity and the authentication process.
	- To remove some password quality policies and set minimum length:
		- `sudo pam-auth-update` - this will open `common-password` file overrider. Unselect `pwquality`, `fingerprint`
		- `sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-password ` and remove `obscure` and add `minlen=1` to line containing `pam_unix.so`
		- Now you can change your password to `1` using `passwd`
