			- Started the development of REST API over pure Socket and ServerSocket using [RawHttp](https://github.com/renatoathaydes/rawhttp) Java library. Commit ref is [here](https://github.com/sabyrzhan/rss-news-feed/commit/11a8529f8f7a9953399bff1bdd38ad7c4f0c2c55)
				- Researched about parsers from any knows web servers. Looks like it is not easy to just use one of their library according to [this](https://stevenyue.com/blogs/http-message-parsing-in-java-web-servers/) article. [This](https://github.com/steventen/http-parser-benchmark) is the benchmark that he tried to make using Netty and RawHttp libraries.
				- If does not work I think I will just use [SparkJava](http://sparkjava.com/) microframework since it provides pure libraries for REST API development. #sparkjava
					- Don't want to use any Spring or Quarkus like frameworks since their very fat.
				- [Here](https://medium.com/consulner/framework-less-rest-api-in-java-dd22d4d642fa) I also found out, that it is possible to use using `HttpServer` class which is coming from `com.sun.net.httpserver.*` package. I thought that all the packages from JDK that contains name `sun` are internal and discouraged to use. However, looks like my thoughts are wrong. Because `BalusC` is strictly pointing [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3732328) that this is OK to use except packages that **start** with `sun.*` name which are internal.
