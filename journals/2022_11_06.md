			- Started the development of REST API over pure Socket and ServerSocket using [RawHttp](https://github.com/renatoathaydes/rawhttp) Java library. Commit ref is [here](https://github.com/sabyrzhan/rss-news-feed/commit/11a8529f8f7a9953399bff1bdd38ad7c4f0c2c55)
				- Researched about parsers from any knows web servers. Looks like it is not easy to just use one of their library according to [this](https://stevenyue.com/blogs/http-message-parsing-in-java-web-servers/) article.
				- If does not work I think I will just use [SparkJava](http://sparkjava.com/) microframework since it provides pure libraries for REST API development. #sparkjava
					- Don't want to use any Spring or Quarkus like frameworks since their very fat.
