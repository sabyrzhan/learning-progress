			- Tried to use embedded jetty with VirtualThread based custom thread pool based on [this](https://mbien.dev/blog/entry/configuring-eclipse-jetty-to-use) article. However, it is not working. The server is dying in 1-2 seconds after it is started.
			- Used [this](https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Jetty/article.html) and [this](https://www.baeldung.com/jetty-embedded) articles which describe how to embed Jetty to your own app.
			- The reason I started thinking about using existing embeddable servers, because implementing HTTP servers is really quite challenging using pure SocketServer and Socket classes. Actually, I implemented it. However, for some reason when sending HTTP request using Postman or JMeter for example, the server is receiving 2 requests instead of actual 1: first one that is coming - does not contain any content (neither request address nor other data) and after that there comes second request with actual request data. Maybe this is because of the TCP nature. Since this is raw data over TCP, maybe I have to correctly also handle TCP ACK-SYN operations. But not sure.
			- [This](https://github.com/sabyrzhan/rss-news-feed/commit/ffb2f52267f69df918f38fbdadd9589ca18881a7) is the last commit where I am trying with embedded Jetty server.
