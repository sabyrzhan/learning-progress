			- Added `String readRequestData(InputStream socketInputStream)` method. However it is hanging indefinitely when reading from `ServerSocket` InputStream.
			- Since I am implementing the request reader functionality myself, looks like it is quite challenging to read request data. When I am reading `GET` request there is no issue, since it is not containing request body. However, when reading `POST` request with body for example, I have take into account the request format. For example, headers, line breaks between headers and body and the end of the body.
			- So currently I am stuck at this point.
