			- `ServerSocket` and `Socket` are blocking APIs. Using pure API api for server development is a worst decision. Because it cannot candle high load (it really fails with 500 RPS for just ping/pong requests). These API can only be used for simple server that handles less load and to implement in classic `thread-per-request` model
			- Better to use nonblocking `Java NIO` #[[java nio]] which lets to use one thread to handle multiple requests. The main components of `Java NIO` are:
				- `Channels` - used to move into and out of buffers to and from various I/O sources like files, sockets, datagrams and etc. There are main implementations of the channels which are commonly used:
					- `ServerSocketChannel` - used only to accept the connection. But neither to read or write data
					- `SocketChannel` - used to read and write data to connection
					- `DatagramChannel` - used to work with UDP protocol
				- Buffers - the main holder of the chunk. In `NIO` all the data are operated through buffers. So there are implementations of all the primitive types except boolean like `ByteBuffer`, `IntBuffer`, `FloatBuffer` etc.
				- `Selector` - used to operate select specific channel by selector key. Many channel can register themselves to operate for specific case. For example, for reading or writing. This lets to handle the specific operations without blocking.
