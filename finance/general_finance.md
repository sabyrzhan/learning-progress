## Time value of money (TVM)
TVM - is the concept that sum of money is worth now than the value at future date.

## Interest types
1. Simple interest - amount is always earned based on present value.
    1. Example: 1000$ for 5 years with 10% interest.
    2. Formula: Interest value = P * R * T / 100
        1. P = Principal value
        2. R = interest rate
        3. T = time in years
    3. Value = 1000 * 10 * 5 / 100 = 500$
    4. FV (Future value) = Principal amount + Total interest = 1000 + 500 = 1500$
2. Compound interest - the interest value is added every year to the value of previous year. With the same example above:
    1. FV (Future value) = P * (1 + R)^T
    2. FV = 1000 * (1 + 0.1)^5 = 1000 * 1.61051 = 1610.51$
3. Intra year compound interest: FV = P * (1 + R / m)^Tm - where m number of compounding in year:
    1. Annually: m = 1
    2. Semi-annually: m = 2
    3. Quarterly: m = 4
    4. Monthly: m = 12
    5. Example: 10 000$ deposit for 4 years with 12% interest:
        1. Annually: FV = 10 000 * (1 + 0.12 / 1)^(4 * 1) = 15 735$
        2. Semiannually: FV = 10 000 * (1 + 0.12 / 2)^(4 * 2) = 15 938$ 
        3. Quarterly: FV = 10 000 * (1 + 0.12 / 4)^(4 * 4) = 16 047$ 
        4. Monthly: FV = 10 000 * (1 + 0.12 / 12)^(4 * 12) = 16 122$ 


Present value can be calculated out from FV formula:
1. P = FV / (1 + R)^T
2. Example: deposit value of $500 000 after 10 years with 13% interest.
    1. P = 500 / (1 + 0.13)^10 = 500 / 3.3946 = $147.29

## Anuity
Anuity is the constant cash flow (payment or receipt) occurring at regualar time interval.

Formula:
* FVA = A * ((1 + r)^T - 1)/R where A is the constant periodic flow
