## [[Runtime Polymorphism]]
	- **Dynamic Method Dispatch** or **Runtime Polymorphism in Java** is a way by which **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** determines which version of the same method in the inherited classes should be called ruing the runtime.
	- It follows **dynamic or late binding** where the method call will be done according to the type of object being referred to and not the reference variable.
	- Runtime polymorphism in Java isn't applicable to data members. Methods can be overridden but not data members.
	- **Static binding** focuses on the reference type and determines the method call during compilation itself. On the contrary, **dynamic binding** focuses on the type of object and the method call can be determined only during the runtime.
